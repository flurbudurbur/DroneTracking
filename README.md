# The assignment

You must make a python program which is able to detect faces and deem them an _Enemy_, _Friend_ or _Unknown_. If they're an _Enemy_, the drone must follow their face and face their direction. The interface will go through LabView which should be able to access all the drone's functions.

## pre-requisites

* Python 3.10 (using 3.10.11 64-bit)
* Tello Drone
* [OpenCV-python](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python)
* [DJITelloPy](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy)

## Getting started

Installing OpenCV and DJITelloPy is done via opening your terminal (powershell, etc) and executing the below command.

```python
pip install opencv-python djitellopy
```
